          Difference between SQL and NoSQL
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            From analysts and engineers to IT decision makers, many are familiar
            with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and the
            Structured Query Language (SQL) used to interact with them. While
            these terms refer to a decades-old paradigm which remains a wide
            standard, today the sheer variety and depth of database systems can
            be dizzying. What’s more, rising volumes of unstructured data,
            availability of storage and processing power, and evolving analytic
            requirements have generated interest in fundamentally different
            technologies. Collectively known as NoSQL, these popular
            alternatives to traditional RDBMSs show promise for a variety of
            modern use cases. To make informed decisions about which to use,
            practitioners should be aware of the differences between SQL, NoSQL,
            individual Database Management Systems (DBMS) and languages, as well
            as the situations each is best-suited for, and how the landscape is
            changing.

          What is JWT, and how does it work?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely
            transmitting information between parties as JSON object. It is
            compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a
            public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and
            authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.
            The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the
            authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.
            JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is
            a client-side based stateless session, server doesn't have to
            completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session
            information.

          What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?

        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
             Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing
            scripts on the website. <br /> And NodeJS is a Javascript runtime
            environment.

          How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            I understand that Node.js uses a single-thread and an event loop to
            process requests only processing one at a time which is
            non-blocking. But still, how does that work, lets say 10,000
            concurrent requests. The event loop will process all the requests?
            Would not that take too long? I can not understand yet how it can
            be faster than a multi-threaded web server. I understand that
            multi-threaded web server will be more expensive in resources
            memory, CPU, but would not it still be faster? I am probably
            wrong; please explain how this single-thread is faster in lots of
            requests, and what it typically does in high level when servicing
            lots of requests like 10,000. And also, will that single-thread
            scale well with that large amount? Please bear in mind that I am
            just starting to learn Node.js.
